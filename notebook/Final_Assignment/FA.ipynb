    "#### EPA1333 Final Assignment\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Regardless of the many debates over the impact of humans on climate change, global warming is an observable fact. According to NASA, highest 16 global temperatures have been recorded since 2001, the arctic ice shrank to a minimum in 2012, and carbon dioxide levels in the air are higher than ever!\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis can help us better understand how the climate has changed, why, to make predictions for the future years, and to evaluate measures on how to suppress these changes. In this assignment you receive climate change data from World Bank, and are expected to perform an original and non-trivial analysis using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Climate change indicators\n",
    "The climate change data offered by World Bank contains a large set of indicators, such as for example CO2 emissions, population growth or renewable energy output. Values of these indicators are available per country and per year. You can download the data in *.csv format from https://data.worldbank.org/topic/climate-change."

    "* The conceptual contents of the Notebook should be roughly similar to a normal written report of 10-20 pages.\n",
    "* Some (minimum) properties of the Notebook and your analyses on which we will grade:\n",
    "    * Required: Combine different data from multiple sources in your analyses.\n",
    "    * Required: Use multiple types of visualizations of your results.\n",
    "    * Required: Make sure your Notebook does not generate errors!\n",
    "    * Required: You should use Python to answer your research questions. Your code should read, clean and format, process and visualize the data. There should be at least some non-trivial processing involved.\n",
    "    * Whenever possible, make your Notebook read the data directly from the web. This way, your notebook will always use the most up-to-date data available. If not, document carefully where the data was collected what to do when you want to use more up-to-date data.\n",
    "    * Demonstrate your skills in Python by using typical Python constructs and using the appropriate data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, arrays, dataframes, series, recursion, etc.)\n",
    "    * Write clear, understandable code:\n",
    "        * Document your code! Put comments when necessary.\n",
    "        * Use sensible variable names.\n",
    "        * Break up your code into parts. Use (fruitful) functions.\n",
    "    * Try to think of reusability of your code. How easy would it be to use your same code if we want to try to do a small variations of your analysis? Can we easily adapt/play around with your code?\n",
    "    * How difficult were your analyses?\n",
    "* Make your Notebook self-explanatory. So, it should contain text (with references) as well as your actual analysis code and results.\n",
    "* If you want to use other libraries for your analyses or visualizations, feel free to do so. However, only use free available and well-known libraries. The ones that come standard with Anaconda are fine. If you want to use something else, that you first need to install, check with us first.\n",
