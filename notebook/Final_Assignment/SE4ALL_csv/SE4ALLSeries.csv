"1.1_ACCESS.ELECTRICITY.TOT","Access to energy","Access to electricity (% of total population)","","Access to electricity (% of total population): Percentage of total population with access to electricity","Data for access to electricity are collected among different sources: mostly data from nationally representative household surveys (including national censuses) were used. Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), other nationally developed and implemented surveys, and various government agencies (for example, ministries of energy and utilities). Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, a number of countries have gaps in available data. To develop the historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple modeling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points - around 1990, around 2000, and around 2010. Therefore, a country can have a continuum of zero to three data points.  The model keeps the original observation if data is available for any of the time periods. This modeling approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 212 countries over these three time periods (Indicated as ""Estimate""). Notation ""Assumption"" refers to the assumption of universal access in countries classified as developed by the United Nations.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",

"10.1_ENERGY.SAVINGS","Energy efficiency","Energy savings of primary energy (TJ)","","Energy savings of primary energy (TJ): Energy savings due to realized energy intensity improvements. Country level savings represent the difference between a hypothetical energy consumption that would have been should the energy intensity remained at its 1990 level and actual consumption.

"11.1_THERMAL.EFFICIENCY","Energy efficiency","Thermal efficiency in power supply (%)","","Thermal efficiency in power supply (%):  This supply-side energy efficiency indicator measures the efficiency of thermal plants in converting primary energy sources—such as coal, gas, and oil—into electricity. It is calculated by dividing gross electricity production from electricity and cogeneration plants by total inputs of fuels into those plants. Whether market-based or privately owned, self-generating plants that do not export their power are included in the index assessment. In the case of cogeneration plants, fuel inputs are allocated between electricity and heat production in proportion to their shares of the annual output.","%","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",
"12.1_TD.LOSSES","Energy efficiency","Transmission and distribution losses (%)","","Transmission and distribution losses (%): Transmission and distribution (T&D) losses measure power lost in the transmission of (high-voltage) electricity from power generators to distributors and in the distribution of (medium- and low-voltage) electricity from distributors to end-users. T&D losses are represented as a percentage of gross electricity production. They include both technical and nontechnical (or commercial) losses. Included in the latter are unmetered, unbilled, and unpaid electricity, including theft, which could be significant in developing countries. Aggregate T&D system indicators may be dominated by factors other than losses. The location of primary energy resources (such as hydro lakes and coal seams) and large loads (cities and industries) may be more significant factors in T&D efficiency indicators than the losses or efficiency of the transmission system itself. Properly separating true losses (and hence the efficiency potential of transmission systems) from exogenous location and scale factors and non-technical losses would require detailed studies of system-dynamic interactions and real operating requirements that are not practical for global tracking purposes.","%","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",
